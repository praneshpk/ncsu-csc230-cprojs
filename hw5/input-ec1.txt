THIS FILE HAS A LOT OF
CAPITAL LETTERS.  THESE
DON"T HAVE SHORT CODES,
SO THIS FILE WOULD ACTUALLLY
GET LARGER UNDER COMPRESSION.
IF YOU DID THE EXTRA CREDIT,
YOUR PROGRAM WILL NOTICE THIS
AND WRITE OUT THIS FILE IN
UNCOMPRESSED FORMAT.  THIS
WILL STILL MAKE IT LARGER,
BUT JUST BY ONE BYTE.  IF
WE WROTE OUT THE WHOLE THING
IN OUR CCOMPRESSED FORMAT,
IT WOULD GET ABOUT 40 PERCENT
LARGER.
