Lines that {
    start {
with a
closing { bracket
like this one
} get their indentation
level reduced before the
} line { gets
printed
{
  that way
  a closing curly bracket
  can line up with {
  the matching opening bracket
  }
}
}}
But, as you can see
from that last line,
this {
only works
for the
}
first curly bracket.
