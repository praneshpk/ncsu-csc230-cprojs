Lines that {
  start {
    with a
    closing { bracket
      like this one
    } get their indentation
    level reduced before the
  } line { gets
    printed
    {
      that way
      a closing curly bracket
      can line up with {
        the matching opening bracket
      }
    }
  }}
But, as you can see
from that last line,
this {
  only works
  for the
}
first curly bracket.
