This file
contains some hard tabs.
{
	when these occur
		at the start of a line, {
	they should be
}
  	  	  removed (along
  with spaces.)
{
but, when a 	tab	occurs
inside {
	a line
} it shouldn't be {
removed }
or changed.
A blank line, like this

doesn't get indented at all.
If a line contains only spaces
and tabs like the next line,
           		 
these spaces or tabs will be discarded, but
no indenting spaces will be inserted.
