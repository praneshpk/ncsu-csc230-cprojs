add 12:00 13:00 Bill A long topic, that may require a few reallocations to store.  This is why we're storing the topic in a separate array, rather than in the activity struct itself.  If we stored it right in the struct, we'd have to leave enough room for a big string like this, which would be a waste of space for most activities (that have much shorter titles).  By storing it separately, outside the struct, we can use a longer dynamically allocated array when we need to, and a shorter one where we can.
